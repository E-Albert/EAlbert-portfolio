          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Emerson Albert! Don't forget it, I might be important to
            you one day. I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. Where you can
            experience all four seasons in one day and the nightlife never
            stops. I'm on my way to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer but the
            main goal is to be a Software Engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            My story starts at the University of Central Florida, where I began
            diving into the world of coding. The more lines I typed, the
            stronger the passion grew. The ability to create something from just
            your imagination is very powerful and we as coders are able to do
            that with just a couple of keystrokes. I am honored to be apart of
            any team or client that I will be representing. Lets get to work!
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of sitting in front of my laptop, I like to play basketball
            and play video games. I don't mind schooling someone on the court or
            online. Both of these hobbies taught be how to perfect my craft and
            to utilize teamwork and thats that I strive to show in the content
            that I produce.
          </p>
