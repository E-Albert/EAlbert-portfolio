and how to contact them

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Welcome to my website! My name is Emerson Albert and I was born in
        Miami, Florida. I'm currently residing in Orlando, Florida where I
        attended the University of Central Florida. In my free time I just like
        to play basketball and play a lot of video games. I always had a thing
        for programming but I didn't get into it much until recently. Now that I
        am actively pursuing this passion of mine I get to showcase what I've
        been working on and I am very honored that you came to check me out and
        see the magic that I've developed.
